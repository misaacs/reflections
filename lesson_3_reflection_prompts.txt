Q:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:
A geographically remote repository has the advantage of being safe from data crashes and local hardware/software issues- assuming the minimal presence of RAID backup remotely. It also allows work to proceed from multiple computers and multiple developers over any time zone, reducing space-time constraints.

Q:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:
It's possible that the remote repository contains data that is similar to what you're working on- the same function or classes but a custom implementation. Autamatic updates could cause inconsistencies in your local version- best to allow the programmer to decide.

Q:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A:
Forks to branch off from and develop someone else's repository.
Clones to make a local copy.
Branches to try alternative implementations of an already existing repository while preserving the integrity of the 'main' repository line, for the time being.
